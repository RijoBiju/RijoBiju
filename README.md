# üí´ About Me:
Hi there! I‚Äôm a student who is passionate about programming and loves to work with Python. I‚Äôve been honing my skills in Python and am pretty good at it. My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer.<br><br>Currently, I‚Äôm working on a gallery organizing project that involves using Python to sort and organize images. In addition, I‚Äôve also used PyQt to create an app that displays game information, which has helped me gain experience in GUI development.<br><br>I‚Äôm also keen on getting into open source and contributing to projects that align with my interests. I believe that collaborating with other developers on open source projects is a great way to learn new skills, gain valuable experience, and make a positive impact on the community.<br><br>
